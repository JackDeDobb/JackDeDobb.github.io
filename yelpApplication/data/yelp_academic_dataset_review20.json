We got to see Wayne's World! FilmBar is one of my favorite places to grab a drink. And now I've finally seen a movie there! It's a wonderful theatre with a retro vibe. You can't beat having a bar right in the lobby! (Priorities, I have them.)\n\nFilmBar was oh-so-very-graciously generous. I used my drink ticket to enjoy a wonderful Malbec. Fancy!\n\nI stuffed 'ma belly right before the show with Short Leash heavenly food. (Thanks for the tasty nibbles to sample!) The jalape\u00f1o popper was right up my alley. \n\nI had *no* idea the regular 'dogs were So. BIG. Bejeebers. And yet I managed to 95% finish my Aiko (complete with gooey mango chutney, jalape\u00f1os, red onions, cilantro and mayo). I love how they have a standard menu, but, also allow you to custom build a 'dog. Next time Irene PACE YOURSELF. \n\nFabulous fun event! I can't wait to return to catch another Staff Pick in the July series. Thank you Film Bar! Thank you Short Leash! Thank you Lindsey!", "type": "review", "business_id": "nYer89hXYAoddMEKTxw7kA"}

A great evening out - and I can't wait to do it again!\n\nI'd never been to FilmBar before - and definitely look forward to heading back - what a great venue!

I was transported right back to NY and the original movie theaters of my childhood. Well, all except the fact this one has a bar, a cool lounge, and some great art hanging on the walls. lol. I had never been here before so was very happy to score an invite. My \"Plus One friend\" loves it here so she was raring to go. I adore the Roosevelt Row area so much so we added this to the really cool things to do in Downtown. Bonus points for eating at Trumpets Ale before the gig. Two new places in one night on Roosevelt Row spells awesomeness. \n\nWe tried all day to guess which \"surprise, locally filmed movie\" they were going to show. I kept guessing \"Raising Az\" because it is the SunDevil in me. CG hates that one. We sparred all day. I crossed my fingers she wouldn't just walk out if they played that one. All her picks were awesome too! We hope to see any of them in the next few months as Yelp picks. Surprisingly, it was really exciting to go to a theater when you had no idea what movie was going to be shown until the credits started flowing. ( I see this as a new home movie party trend)  Az has a long history of movie magic and we had over 200 films to chose from. We were all on the edge of our seats. When the first words to pop up were \"A Lorne Michaels Film\" We heard a loud, \"WOOP!\" from some fellow Rowdy Yelpers.  I still did not know which SNL film it was until the title popped up. I was pretty surprised. I thought I knew most of the films on the local list but forgot about Wayne's World. Lol-- how funny. I relived some of my eighties college music days and definitely those hair band experiences growing up on Long Island listening to Metal/Rock groups like; Zebra, Alice Cooper, and Poison. (Just to name a few)  \n\nWe had a great time tonight. We can not wait to go back. Coincidentally, I had just watched \"World's End\" last night. FilmBar is having a \"Shaun of the Dead\" party on the 25th. I think I heard something about a Zombie Pinata, and that dressing up party Shenanigans were predicted to ensue. Yes, please. Thanks Lindsey and Filmbar Gang for bringing back my \"College, \"EH-Hem,\" I mean \"Ballroom-- Blitz\" drama days.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nYer89hXYAoddMEKTxw7kA"}

Party time! Excellent!\n\nWhat a great movie choice for the first Yelp Secret Cinema!

We had dinner from Short Leash Dogs and a free drink on the house! I went for the chicken dog and added some of my favorite toppings and a sweet pear cider. \nNow, I was all set for the movie! \n\nLindsey wouldn't tell us the movie before it started. Duh it was a secret! We sat in suspense for a minute, but when the opening credits started many Yelpers had a clue! It's funny, my plus one (Leigh C.) had NEVER seen Wayne's World before. She was just a tot when the movie was popular and it was hilarious to see a person watch Wayne's World for the first time!
